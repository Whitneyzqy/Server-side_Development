## Creative component:
I add og:site_name tag to the project. Here is the link for testing: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3281548/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0
For css style changes, I make the content text be black and then when hover the text, the text color will change to a lightblue color. 
In this case, users can better read through the text and see the hover interaction as a web link.
